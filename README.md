# Power BI Documentation Generator

Generates one self-contained, interactive HTML page per Power BI report: what the
semantic model contains, where its data comes from, how the report uses the model,
what could be removed, and what to watch out for. A **report library** page
(`pbi-home.html`) ties the pages together.

It reads Power BI project files (PBIP) directly, or PBIX files through
[pbi-tools](https://pbi.tools). Python 3.10+ standard library only: no `pip install`,
no server, no connection to any database or to the Power BI service. The output
works offline and can be emailed, put on SharePoint or committed to a repo.

## Quick start

### A folder of PBIX files (Windows)

Install Power BI Desktop and **pbi-tools Desktop**, then:

```powershell
python generate_docs.py --pbix-folder "C:\Reports" --output-dir "C:\Documentation" --pbi-tools "C:\Tools\pbi-tools\pbi-tools.exe" --recursive
```

Open `C:\Documentation\pbi-home.html`. Each PBIX gets its own page, named
`<report>--<hash>.html` so reports with the same name in different folders do not
collide. A file that fails is listed in the summary and does not stop the others;
extraction logs are in `pbix-logs\`. Use `--pbix FILE` for a single file.

The batch asks pbi-tools for its single-file model layout and also accepts its
folder and TMDL layouts. Some older PBIX files make pbi-tools ignore the extract
folder and write next to the PBIX; the batch moves that output into its own
working folder. If a previous run left such a folder beside a PBIX, delete it
before rerunning.

### A Power BI project (PBIP)

```
python generate_docs.py --project path/to/Sales.pbip --output docs/Sales.html
```

`--project` also accepts the project folder or either artifact folder
(`Sales.SemanticModel`, `Sales.Report`); the other half is found through
`definition.pbir`. To name them yourself:

```
python generate_docs.py --model Sales.SemanticModel --report Sales.Report --output docs/Sales.html
```

To save a PBIX as a project: in Power BI Desktop choose **File → Save as** and the
`.pbip` type. Recent Desktop versions save the model as TMDL and the report as
PBIR by default; older versions may need the preview features enabled under
**File → Options and settings → Options → Preview features**.

## Supported inputs

| Input | Read |
|---|---|
| Semantic model | TMDL (`definition/` folder), TMSL (`model.bim`), and pbi-tools extracts in Raw, folder and TMDL layouts |
| Report | PBIR (`definition/pages/...`), the legacy single-file `report.json` / PBIX `Layout`, and pbi-tools' split report folders. PBIR inside a PBIX is read from the file itself |
| Legacy models | Pre-2019 models whose tables read `SELECT * FROM [Table]` from a `Microsoft.PowerBI.OleDb` source: the Power Query packed in that source is traced instead |

You can supply a model, a report or both:

| Mode | What you get | What it will not claim |
|---|---|---|
| **Combined** (model + report) | Everything below. | — |
| **Model only** | Tables, measures, relationships, sources, security, warnings. | Never calls anything unused, since reports are unknown. |
| **Report only** | Pages, visuals, filters, bookmarks and a field manifest: every field the report needs. | Cannot confirm the fields exist or trace them to a source. |

A PBIX with no embedded model (a report on a published dataset) is documented as
report only.

## What is in a report page

The page opens on **Overview**. The left rail has six sections:

| Section | Views |
|---|---|
| Overview | Counts, sources at a glance, usage summary, documentation coverage (measures, columns and tables described) and duplicate measures |
| Data & sources | Tables, Columns, Measures, Relationships, Lineage, Sources, Primary sources, Security |
| Pages & visuals | Page layout, Pages, Filters, Field manifest |
| Impact & usage | Impact inspector, Usage matrix, Usage |
| Review issues | Cleanup review, Warnings |
| Report details | Report location, library folder and connection notes (see [below](#the-report-library-and-report-details)) |

A bar above each view holds the **Report page** selector, which filters usage views
and exports to one page, and an analysis-coverage badge; select the badge to see
what limited the analysis. Cleanup, counts, relationships, security and warnings
always cover the whole report.

Highlights:

- **Relationships** draws the model as a diagram with zoom and a focus-table picker.
- **Lineage** shows sources → model tables → report pages; select a node to highlight its paths.
- **Page layout** draws each page from saved visual positions (not rendered charts),
  colours visuals by kind and lists the measures (Σ) and columns each one uses.
  Untitled visuals are named by type and first field ("Card · Revenue"); custom
  visuals by their package name ("Mapbox Visual (custom)").
- **Pages** lists each page's data visuals with their fields; buttons, shapes and
  images without data are folded into one "decorative visuals" row.
- **Measures** are grouped by display folder, with DAX, format string, the pages
  that use them and their dependencies.
- **Impact inspector** shows everything downstream of a column or measure, down to the visuals.

Raw page IDs (`ReportSection…`) appear only in tooltips and exports, unless two
pages share a name.

## Sources

Sources are traced statically through Power Query (M) and embedded SQL, including
shared queries, parameters, custom functions and "Combine files" helper queries.
Nothing is executed and no connection is made.

**Sources** lists one row per external source with its model tables, report pages,
reporting usage and identification status. **Primary sources** lists each external
input per report page and exports it as CSV.

| Kind | Connectors |
|---|---|
| Databases | SQL Server (including native queries), Azure SQL / Synapse, Oracle (service, TNS alias, native SQL), Teradata (navigation, native SQL), Snowflake, Databricks, ODBC |
| Files | Excel, CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, PDF, Access; on local drives, UNC shares and mapped drives; whole folders ("Folder · (all files)") |
| SharePoint and OneDrive | Lists (Online and on-premises; lists picked by ID show a short ID), files through SharePoint.Files, SharePoint.Contents or a document URL |
| Services | Web / API, OData, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake, Power BI and Power Platform dataflows |
| Inside the model | Entered data, data generated in Power Query, calculated (DAX) tables. Shown, but not treated as external sources |

| Identification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Resolved | Connection and object identified from the code. Not a live check. |
| Partial | Object identified, but some context is external or uncertain (for example an ODBC DSN, or a source used only by a bookmark with no page). |
| Unresolved | The code could not be traced to an object. |

Unquoted Oracle names are folded to upper case, so `billing.tariff` and
`BILLING.TARIFF` are one source. Credentials in connection strings and URLs are
never copied into source identities.

## Cleanup: which columns and measures can be removed

**Cleanup review** gives each column and measure an assessment:

| Assessment | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Keep** | Used by the report, or needed inside the model: a measure (even an unused one), calculated column or table, relationship, hierarchy, sort-by column, RLS filter or dynamic format. |
| **Deletion candidate** | No reference found in the supplied model and report. Check other reports, Analyze in Excel users and composite models before deleting; the tool cannot see them. |
| **Review** | Usage cannot be settled, for the reasons below. |

What holds columns in Review:

- **A whole-table dependency**, such as `COUNTROWS(DISTINCT(T))` or `FILTER(T, …)`,
  holds every column of T. A plain `COUNTROWS(T)` does not, since removing a column
  cannot change a row count.
- **A missing field on a table that exists**, such as a report binding to `Sales[Old]`,
  holds that table.
- **A reference with no table** that cannot be resolved, or an unreadable
  definition, holds everything.
- **A reference to a table that does not exist** is reported but holds nothing: it
  cannot depend on a column that exists.
- **A visual whose data query cannot be read** holds everything.

Bookmark fields count as used. Only their page is uncertain, which does not change
a deletion decision. Reports in the older layouts get the same assessment as PBIR.

Duplicate measures (the same DAX under different names, ignoring whitespace,
comments and case) are listed as well.

## Warnings

Warnings list inactive relationships, bidirectional filters, missing date tables,
disconnected tables, legacy report layouts and **broken bindings**: fields the
report uses that the model does not have. Each broken binding says where it is
used ("Used on: Pipeline Trends — Page filter"), and a reference used only by
formatting reads "A formatting rule refers to …".

## The report library and report details

Every run refreshes `pbi-home.html` beside the output. It has three views:

- **Reports**: a card per report with its mode, analysis coverage, cleanup
  candidates, duplicate measures and sources, grouped by folder.
- **Sources**: which reports use each server, database or file.
- **Manage library**: refresh the list from a folder and download the refreshed page.

It lists the HTML files directly in its folder. To rebuild it from existing files
without reading any Power BI files:

```
python generate_docs.py --catalog "C:\Documentation"
```

In a report page, **Report details** records the original report location, a
library folder (such as `Finance / Monthly`) and connection notes (connection name,
authentication, username or service account). These are notes you maintain, never
passwords, so don't put secrets in them. To keep your edits, choose **Download
updated HTML** and replace the original file. Details survive regeneration to the
same file name and PBIX batch reruns. They can also be applied with
`--metadata FILE.json`:

```json
{
  "reportLocation": "C:\\Reports\\Finance\\Sales.pbip",
  "folder": "Finance / Monthly",
  "connections": [{"sourceType": "SQL Server", "server": "sql01", "database": "Reporting",
                   "connectionName": "Reporting warehouse", "username": "CORP\\report_reader",
                   "authentication": "Windows"}]
}
```

## Other outputs: CSV, JSON, Word, agent context

- **CSV exports in the page**: the column and page inventory, the table source
  summary, primary sources, source objects (with or without code), all M queries,
  cleanup evidence and measure assessments. File names start with the report name.
- **`--csv PATH`**: the full column and page inventory, which needs a model.
- **`--json PATH`**: the whole analysis as JSON. Every HTML page also embeds it
  (`const DATA = {…}`), so the pages double as machine-readable records.
- **`--word PATH`**: a `.docx` narrative of the same analysis for handovers and sign-off.
- **`--agent [PATH]`**: a compact Markdown version for LLM agents.

All renderings come from one analysis, so they cannot disagree.

## Command-line reference

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--project` | `.pbip` file, project folder, or either artifact folder |
| `--model` | `.SemanticModel` folder (TMDL or TMSL), its `definition/` folder, or `model.bim` |
| `--report` | `.Report` folder (PBIR or legacy `report.json`) |
| `--output`, `-o` | HTML path (default `<name>.html`) |
| `--title` | Document title |
| `--json`, `--csv`, `--word`, `--agent` | Extra outputs (see above) |
| `--pbix FILE` / `--pbix-folder FOLDER` | Document PBIX files through pbi-tools |
| `--output-dir` | PBIX output folder (default `<input>/documentation`) |
| `--recursive` | Include PBIX files in subfolders |
| `--pbi-tools EXE` | Path to `pbi-tools.exe` |
| `--extract-timeout` | Seconds per PBIX (default 600) |
| `--catalog FOLDER` | Rebuild `pbi-home.html` from existing pages |
| `--metadata JSON` | Apply report details from a file |
| `--no-hub` | Do not refresh `pbi-home.html` |

## Limitations

- **Static analysis.** DAX and M are read, not executed. Values decided at runtime,
  such as field parameters or dynamic SQL, may not resolve, and are then marked
  Partial, Unresolved or Review instead of guessed.
- **One report's view.** A deletion candidate is unused by *this* report and model
  only. Other reports on the same dataset, Excel users and composite models are invisible.
- **No live checks.** Sources are what the code names; the tool does not confirm
  that they exist or which view reads which table.
- **Page layout** is a schematic from saved positions, not a rendering.
- **pbi-tools** needs Windows and Power BI Desktop. PBIP projects need neither.
- **Not tested against real files:** DirectQuery against a live database and live
  connections to a published dataset. Synthetic samples cover their code patterns.

## Development and testing

```
python tests/run_ci.py
```

This runs the full suite (163 tests at the time of writing, including checks that
run the generated JavaScript under Node.js when it is installed) and fails if
tests are skipped. There is no CI workflow; run it locally.

Browser checks (Playwright and Chromium):

```
npm install --no-save playwright@1.62.1 && npx playwright install chromium
python tests/build_browser_fixture.py
node tests/browser_review.cjs /tmp/pbidocgen-browser.html
node tests/browser_catalog.cjs
```
